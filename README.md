# JimMillerDrums.com

Professional drummer in New York City. Focused on groove, reliability, and
helping the band sound better.

This repository contains the source code and infrastructure for my personal
site. I built this to have a fast, minimalist digital presence that stays out
of the way and lets the music speak for itself.

## The Goal

In the NYC music scene, a website is a digital business card. It needs to:

1. Load instantly on a phone (often on the subway).
2. Showcase high-quality audio and video.
3. Be simple to maintain so I can get back to practicing.

## Tech Stack (The "Under the Hood" for the curious)

- **SSG:** [Zola](https://getzola.org) (Built in Rust)
- **Infrastructure:** OpenTofu (AWS S3 + CloudFront)
- **Deployment:** GitHub Actions

_Currently under construction._
